About game: A simple game for any age to develop attentiveness. At the top of the screen there is a timer that counts down to 0. After the countdown ends, some of the panels disappear, and the colors and words are changed in the plate to the right of the timer. At the beginning of each level and every time when the timer shows 0, a notification will appear in the upper left corner. It shows what you will need to pay attention to: the text (words in the plate) or the color (background color in the plate). Your goal is to reach the finish line on the colored panels and not fall into the water.
